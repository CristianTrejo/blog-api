This project is the API for the sample blog application, has only CRUD methods for "posts" and all the data is written in a `db.json` file.

## Run the app

In the project directory, you need to run:

### `npm install` 
&&
### `npm run start`

This will run the app in the development mode listening in `localhost:8080`.\
you can go to `http://localhost:8080/posts` to know it is running.

## Data in application
At the first run the database will be empty, so make sure you create new posts to see them in the UI.
